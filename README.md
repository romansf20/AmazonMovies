# Welcome to Amazon Movies Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

The app features a **Home screen** with a horizontally scrollable movie carousel, as well as **Search** and **Profile screens** as placeholders.

### Features
- **Tabbed Layout**:
  - Includes three main tabs: Home, Search, and Profile.
- **Home Screen**:
  - Displays a list of top movies in a horizontally scrollable carousel.
	- Displays basic movie details in the carousel item.
  - Fetches and displays movies, genres, user ratings, and parental ratings via an API from: 
		- https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started
  - Integrates a full-screen trailer player using a modal overlay.
	- Displays more movie details in the video player modal overlay.
  - Smooth animations for transitions using `react-native-reanimated-carousel`.
- **Search and Profile Screens**:
  - Placeholder screens with static text for future enhancements.

## Design Details

- **Responsive Layout**:
  - Designed to adapt to different screen sizes using `Dimensions`.
- **Reusable Styles**:
  - Centralized styles and helper functions in `movieCommon.tsx` for consistent design.
- **Animations**:
  - Smooth fade-in and fade-out animations for the trailer modal using the `Animated` API.
- **Typography**:
  - Uses the **Amazon Ember** font family for titles and text.
- **Dark Theme**:

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
